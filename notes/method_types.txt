Regular method (prepends the instance if available, otherwise you have to do it).

a.m(x, y)         --> m(a, x, y)   BoundMethod
A.m(a, x, y)      --> m(a, x, y)   UnboundMethod


Class method (prepends the class)

a.m(x, y)          -->  m(a.__class__, x, y)
A.m(x, y)          -->  m(A, x, y)


Static method (doesn't prepend anything)

a.m(x, y)          -->  m(x, y)
A.m(x, y)          -->  m(x, y)
